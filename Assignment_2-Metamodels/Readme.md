To open the project in Eclipse, import the project ```Assignment_2-Metamodels > QVTo_transformation > .project```. This should add in your Eclipse the directories `nl.tue.glt.ccl.metamodel`, `nl.tue.glt.graph.metamodel` and `assignment2`.

To generate a graph of the `.xmi` output file, open the Jupyter plugin in VSCode or use an Jupyter server. This Jupyter file ca be found at ```nl.tue.glt.ccl.metamodel > generated_xmi > draw_graph.ipynb```

The input files can be found at ```nl.tue.glt.ccl.metamodel > generated_xmi > example1.xmi```
The output file can be found at ```nl.tue.glt.ccl.metamodel > generated_xmi > example1_out.xmi```

This input file conforms to all the requirements for an `.xmi` file specified in section `Deliverables`. 

The `.qvto` file can be found in Eclipse at ```asssignment2 > transforms > NewTransformation.qvto``` or in the folder structure it is at ```Assignment_2-Metamodels > QVTo_transformation > transforms > NewTransformation.qvto```.
Line 83, 86, 87 and 90 are commented out so that all transformation requirements are met. They can be uncommented such that the second requirement is broken, but now `Computing` or `Storage` boxes are not shown if they do not have any children.
